## 8. How do end-users consent to receive messages?
**Paste this EXACT text (Twilio's required language):**

```
Customers provide their mobile number directly to the business owner at the time of service. The message sent is strictly informational and relates only to the service the customer just received. No marketing or promotional content is included. The customer's action of receiving the service establishes a prior business relationship, and providing their number constitutes consent to receive a single service-related review request. All messages include STOP/HELP instructions. The customer does not interact directly with MyRevuHQ.
