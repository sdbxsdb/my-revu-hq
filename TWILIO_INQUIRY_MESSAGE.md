**Subject:** A2P 10DLC Campaign - Consent Model for Transactional Service Feedback Messages

**Message:**

Hi Twilio Support,

I'm working on getting my A2P 10DLC campaign approved and have a question about the consent model for my use case.

**My Use Case:**
MyRevuHQ is a platform that enables business owners (plumbers, electricians, contractors, etc.) to request customer reviews via SMS. Here's how it works:

1. A business owner provides a service to a customer (e.g., completes a plumbing job)
2. The customer provides their phone number to the business owner during the service interaction
3. After service completion, the business owner adds the customer to MyRevuHQ
4. MyRevuHQ sends a transactional SMS requesting feedback about the service that was just completed
5. The message includes review links and opt-out instructions

**The Consent Challenge:**
The end-users (customers receiving SMS) never directly interact with MyRevuHQ - they only interact with the business owner who provided them service. The business owner collects customer phone numbers and adds them to the platform.

**My Question:**
Since these are **transactional messages** (requesting feedback about a completed service) sent within an **existing business relationship** (customer provided phone number when receiving service), can I use the "existing business relationship" consent model under TCPA?

Specifically:

- Customer provided phone number to business owner in context of receiving a service
- Business owner has existing business relationship with customer (completed service)
- Messages are transactional (requesting feedback about completed service)
- Messages are only sent after service completion
- All messages include opt-out instructions

Would this consent model be acceptable for A2P 10DLC campaign approval? If not, what alternative consent mechanism would you recommend for this use case where end-users don't directly interact with the platform?

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**Alternative Shorter Version:**

Hi Twilio Support,

I'm seeking approval for an A2P 10DLC campaign where business owners send transactional SMS messages requesting customer feedback after service completion.

**Use Case:** Business owners (plumbers, contractors, etc.) use MyRevuHQ to send review request SMS to customers after completing work. Customers provide their phone number to the business owner during service, and messages are only sent after service completion requesting feedback.

**Question:** Since these are transactional messages within an existing business relationship (customer provided phone number when receiving service), can I use "existing business relationship" as the consent basis under TCPA for A2P 10DLC?

The end-users don't directly interact with MyRevuHQ - they only interact with the business owner. Would this consent model be acceptable, or do you recommend an alternative approach?

Thank you!
